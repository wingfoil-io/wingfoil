# Plan: iceoryx2 PR #176 Comment Closure + Merge Readiness

This plan defines a repeatable process to collect new PR feedback, resolve or defer it explicitly, and get PR #176 to merge-ready state.

Source context:
- Requirements: `docs/requirements/2026-04-05-iceoryx2-adapter-requirements.md`
- Design: `docs/design/2026-04-05-iceoryx2-adapter-design.md`
- Spec: `SPEC.md`
- Tracking: `plan.md`
- Review brainstorm: `docs/brainstorms/2026-04-05-iceoryx2-pr176-review-closure-brainstorm.md`

## Problem Frame

PR #176 is large and review feedback spans architecture, correctness, tests, and operability.
The fastest path to merge is to treat review closure as an explicit workflow with artifacts:
comment inventory → triage → action mapping → verification → reviewer replies.

## Implementation Units

### Unit 1: Feedback Collection Snapshot

Goal: capture a deterministic snapshot of “current PR state”.

Commands (deterministic, copy/paste safe):
- `gh pr view 176 --comments`
- `gh pr view 176 --json latestReviews,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,updatedAt`
- `gh pr checks 176`

Output artifact:
- A short “snapshot” section added to this plan with:
  - `updatedAt` timestamp
  - failing checks + URLs
  - reviewer(s) + blocker list

#### Current Snapshot (2026-04-06)

- PR: `#176` (`feat(adapter): iceoryx2 v2 with daemonless support and Python bindings`)
- Head SHA: `99e488a`
- `mergeStateStatus`: `UNSTABLE`
- `mergeable`: `MERGEABLE`
- Checks:
  - Upstream checks are currently blocked behind maintainer approval (see “Check Visibility Note” below), so `statusCheckRollup` may show empty even when the fork is green.
- Prior CI failure (historical):
  - A previous upstream CI run failed because `taiki-e/cache-cargo-install-action@v2` and `taiki-e/install-action@nextest` were being executed under `/usr/bin/sh` and erroring with “requires bash”.
  - Mitigation in this branch: set workflow default shell to bash in `.github/workflows/rust.yml`.

#### Check Visibility Note

- After pushing a commit that modifies workflow files under `.github/workflows/`, the upstream PR may temporarily show no checks (depending on repository fork/approval policy for workflow changes).
- If checks are not showing on `wingfoil-io/wingfoil`, verify that workflow runs are being created with:
  - `gh run list --repo wingfoil-io/wingfoil --branch feat/iceoryx2-v2`
  - If no new runs appear, request a maintainer to re-run/approve workflows for the updated head SHA.

Current state (post-rebase, 2026-04-06):
- Upstream PR runs were created as `action_required` (no jobs yet), implying maintainer approval is needed to execute:
  - Latest CI run `24012068885`
  - Latest iceoryx2 Integration Tests run `24012068881`

Fork validation (tommy-ca/wingfoil, 2026-04-05):
- Push-triggered runs for the latest head SHA completed successfully:
  - Python Tests run `24010473156`: success
  - iceoryx2 Integration Tests run `24010473162`: success
- Manual workflow_dispatch verification:
  - Python Tests run `24012090606`: success (validates workflow is runnable end-to-end on the branch)
- Reviewer feedback highlights (from latest review by `0-jake-0`):
  - Blocker: background thread lifecycle (store `JoinHandle`, join in `stop()`)
  - Blocker: ensure `Ipc` path is tested (at least one opt-in IPC round-trip)
  - Recommended: remove panic risk in Python (`PyList::new(...).unwrap()`)
  - Recommended: avoid silent publish failures when Python stream values aren’t `bytes` / `list[bytes]`

### Unit 2: Comment-to-Action Mapping Table

Goal: convert feedback into an explicit checklist.

For each feedback item:
- Category: Blocker / Recommended / Nice-to-have
- Status: Fixed / Deferred / Needs decision
- Evidence: file path(s) + test(s) or rationale
- Reply text: 2–6 lines suitable for a PR response

#### Mapping Table (as of 2026-04-05)

| Item | Category | Status | Evidence | Planned Reply |
|------|----------|--------|----------|---------------|
| Replace 1ms sleep / provide `Spin` + `Threaded` + `Signaled` modes | Blocker (older comment) | Fixed | Modes exist in `wingfoil/src/adapters/iceoryx2/mod.rs` and `wingfoil/src/adapters/iceoryx2/read.rs`; Threaded uses ~10µs idle; Signaled uses WaitSet | “Added explicit `Iceoryx2Mode::{Spin,Threaded,Signaled}` with graph-thread polling, background-thread polling, and WaitSet wakeups; removed 1ms latency floor.” |
| Add meaningful round-trip tests (not just compile checks) | Blocker (older comment) | Fixed | Round-trip coverage in `wingfoil/src/adapters/iceoryx2/integration_tests.rs` (Local for all modes + contract mismatch); Python tests in `wingfoil-python/tests/test_iceoryx2.py` | “Added Local round-trip tests for all modes and slice payloads; added Python E2E tests; IPC remains opt-in/ignored.” |
| Thread lifecycle: store `JoinHandle` and join on `stop()` | Blocker | Fixed | Thread handles stored and joined in `wingfoil/src/adapters/iceoryx2/read.rs` (`Iceoryx2ReceiverStream` and `Iceoryx2SliceReceiverStream`) | “Stored join handles for Threaded/Signaled subscriber threads and join them on `stop()` to ensure threads don’t outlive graph shutdown.” |
| IPC (`Ipc` variant) tested | Blocker | Fixed (opt-in) | IPC tests exist behind `iceoryx2-integration-test` and `#[ignore]` in `wingfoil/src/adapters/iceoryx2/integration_tests.rs` | “Added opt-in IPC round-trip coverage gated behind `iceoryx2-integration-test` and ignored by default to keep CI deterministic.” |
| `is_multiple_of()` MSRV concern | Blocker | Fixed | Replaced `is_multiple_of()` with `%` checks in `wingfoil/src/adapters/iceoryx2/read.rs` and `wingfoil/src/adapters/iceoryx2/write.rs` | “Replaced `is_multiple_of()` usage with `%` to avoid MSRV/toolchain ambiguity.” |
| Python: avoid `.unwrap()` on `PyList::new()` | Recommended | Fixed | `wingfoil-python/src/py_iceoryx2.rs` now falls back to `PyList::empty(py)` on allocation error | “Removed `.unwrap()` in the iceoryx2 subscriber mapping to avoid panics inside Python.” |
| Python: avoid silent publish failure (non-bytes values) | Recommended | Fixed | `wingfoil-python/src/py_iceoryx2.rs` now uses `try_map` and errors on invalid types | “Invalid publish inputs now surface as an error instead of silently dropping data.” |
| Nice-to-have: first-class idle strategy | Nice-to-have | Deferred | Not required to close correctness blockers; current Threaded idle is fixed ~10µs | “Deferring to follow-up; current `Threaded` has a simple ~10µs idle strategy; `Signaled` is the primary low-idle-CPU path.” |

### Unit 3: Fix Failing Required Checks

Goal: get required CI green.

Inputs:
- `gh pr checks 176` URLs

Approach:
- Open the failing job log and extract:
  - failure summary
  - exact command(s) that failed
  - first failing file/line
- Fix the minimum set of issues to turn CI green.
- Re-run locally when possible (or add narrow reproduction notes if not).

### Unit 4: Confirm Review Blockers Are Closed

Goal: ensure every “Blocker” item is either fixed or explicitly deferred with rationale + follow-up.

Typical blocker themes for this PR:
- thread lifecycle safety (join on stop; no orphaned threads)
- IPC path tested (at least one opt-in IPC round-trip)
- error surfaces carry typed context (contract mismatch vs open failure)
- Python binding safety (avoid panic paths, avoid silent data loss)

### Unit 5: PR Reply + Merge Checklist

Goal: reduce reviewer effort to near-zero.

Checklist:
- Reply to each reviewer thread with:
  - what changed
  - where it changed (file paths)
  - how it’s verified (tests / workflow)
- Confirm `mergeStateStatus` is not `DIRTY` and `mergeable` is not `CONFLICTING`.
- Confirm all required checks pass.

## Verification

Rust:
- Default: `cargo test -p wingfoil --features iceoryx2-beta`
- Opt-in IPC: `cargo test -p wingfoil --features iceoryx2-beta,iceoryx2-integration-test -- --ignored`

Python:
- Default: `cd wingfoil-python && uv run pytest -q`
- Opt-in IPC: `cd wingfoil-python && WINGFOIL_ICEORYX2_IPC_TESTS=1 uv run pytest -q`

## Risks / Scope Control

- Avoid scope creep (e.g., generalized `IdleStrategy` abstraction) unless it is required to close a blocker.
- Keep IPC tests opt-in unless the project explicitly requires them in default CI.

## Reschedule (Next Steps)

This PR is in “review closure” mode. The next scheduled sweep:
- **Next sweep:** 2026-04-06
- **Cadence:** after each CI run or new comment, refresh Unit 1 snapshot and update the mapping table rows.

Proceeding notes:
- After pushing the “bash default shell” fix and the review blocker fixes, run `gh pr checks 176` and refresh the snapshot with new results.
